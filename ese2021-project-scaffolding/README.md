# ese2021-project-scaffolding

## About
This project contains an Angular frontend and a NodeJs backend which uses Express as a framework. The website displays todolists which can be customized with items to complete. Every list and item is saved in a database, meaning they will still be available after you restart the website or the backend. 

## Prerequisite
First of all you have to install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/de/download/), which comes per default with the packet manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
To verify the installation worked, type `npm -v` and `node -v` in your favourite command line interface (cli). If a version number appears and no error message appears the installation was successful.

## Start
If you would like to use this scaffolding as a basis for your actual project (which we recommend): 
- please download or clone your teams repository (for example, by running `git clone https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2021-team1` at your desired location ), 
- download as a zip file or clone this repository inside your team's repository,
- unzip if downloaded as a zip,
- and ***delete the .git folder*** from this repository (WARNING: keep .git folder from your team's repo). 
Then you can follow the README in the frontend folder and backend folder respectively.<br>

## Technologies 
The image below gives you an overview on the different technologies used. You can find more details about them by consulting the reading list on Ilias. It shows a request the frontend makes to the backend.
