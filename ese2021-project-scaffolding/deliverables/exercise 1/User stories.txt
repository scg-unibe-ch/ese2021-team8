# User stories

## Functional:
1. As a moderator, I want to remove inappropriate posts/ban misbehaving users so that the platform stays a friendly and controlled place.
2. As a user, I want to reset my password in case I have forgotten it, so that I am able to get access to my user profile again.
3. As a system administrator, I want to grant a user the role of a moderator, so that he can help maintaining the platform a friendly place.

## Non-functional:
1. As a user of the website, I want it’s usage to be so intuitive that I do not have to read a manual or forum posts.
2. As a user, I don’t want my personal profile be secure, so that nobody who I don’t know is able to access sensitive data like real name, address or credit card number.
3. As a user, I want to access the website from different platforms such as PC, smartphone or tablet, so that I can be connected to the community all day.
